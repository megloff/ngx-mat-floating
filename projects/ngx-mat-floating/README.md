# NgxMatFloating

This Angular extension allows it to make MatDialog, MatCard and MatExpansionPanel items floating and draggable by adding a single directive.

Although is relatively easy to add basic drag support to an application using the CDK package, to make a more complex component like an Angular 
Material Expansion Panel to work seamlessly requires quite a bit of customization. With NgxMatFloating creating draggable Angular components 
with consistent behavior becomes very easy. 

With NgxMatFloating a component is usually created in its original position as "pinned". The user can "unpin" the component anytime
to make it floating and draggable and with a single click the user can re-pin the component. It will then move itself back into
its original position inside the application layout.

# Examples

There is an example app in the [Git repository](https://github.com/megloff/ngx-mat-floating) for each type of floating component that is currently supported.
